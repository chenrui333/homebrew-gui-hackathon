# homebrew-gui-hackathon
A user friednly interface for popular open source package manager Homebrew.

## Why need a gui for homebrew?
Homebrew is a great package manager which allows the user to download and install thousands of packages which are useful to developers and possibily also 
useful to people who aren't tech savy.

Our goal was to provide this technology to a wider audience so that a new developer or someone with relatively less technical experience who is intimidated by the command line can also use this. 


## Run
We're still working on integrate frontend and backend into a single port. So, to run it, currently you have to open two terminals one is for frontend: <br>
```
npm start
```

another is for backend <br>
```
node server.js
```
